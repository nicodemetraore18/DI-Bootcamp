üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
Instructions
1Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.

2In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.

3Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.

4Add the following methods:
 .train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

 .play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.

 .do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.
